# Caesar Salad

## Rules:
1. Never write your own cryptography
1. But when you do, have fun with it

This uses basic caesar cryptography but without ever sharing the key. All keys remain private keys.

Think of it like a precious chest. You add a lock and send the locked chest to a friend. They add their own lock and send the chest back to you. You remove your lock and send the still locked chest back. They remove their lock and can open the chest.
